Crop Disease and Pest Leaf Identification.

This project aims to develop a model for identifying diseases and pests in crops using leaf images. The model is trained on a dataset of leaf images of various crop species affected by different diseases and pests.

Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the crop disease and pest leaf identification model on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher

TensorFlow 2.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib (for displaying results)

Download the pre-trained model weights from the releases page and place it in the root directory of the project.

Dataset

The dataset used to train the model is not included in this repository. 

Note

This is a work in progress and the model is currently under development. Any contributions and suggestions are welcome!
